Five of our students&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were on the Board of Directors, chairing the Committees. Well done to Evy, Beckett, Ellery, Sam and Sabrina for their hard work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 1200 students participated from 39 schools across the globe includi<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ng schools from Zambia, Qatar and Palestine in the three-day conference debating and collaborating as committees to bring resolutions to current global issues. The conference, much like the smaller Halcyon-<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">based version which will occur later in the year, is entirely student-run. From administration to marketing, to technical assistance; t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he students of The International School of the Hague run the whole event.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated in the MUNISH mission statement, MUNISH is \u201cA conference run by youth, for today\u2019s youth, to benefit the youth of tomorrow\u201d. The theme for this year\u2019s MUNISH conference was: \u2018<span style=\"color: #3176bc;\">Rising to the challenges of exponential change<\/span>\u2019, which promotes and supports action and problem solving on a global scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our delegates represented Bolivia, South Africa and North Korea in their respective committees. Prior to the event, they conducted research into the positions of their countries on the assigned topics to prepare for the debate. There were also a number of workshops that delegates could involve themselves in; Public Speaking and Non-Government Organisations in the United Nations to name a few.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The students of the International School of the Hague delivered some fantastically inspiring speeches to our students during the Opening and Closing ceremonies, emphasising some of the passions that our young people are fighting for. Their future thinking and critical views were in contrast to the ISH Principal and special guest speaker from the United Nations who focused only on the past and how far society has come.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWe, the youth, are not simply the change that we wish for but the change that we need!\u201d said Efstathios, President of the General Assembly (a student). \u201cThe state of global affairs is overwhelming and disheartening. We cannot just hope for a better world but we will make a better world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cUse this opportunity to let your voice and your opinions be heard. Your capacity to make a difference is only limited by your own thinking. It only takes one person to make a change.\u201d said the Secretary General (a student).<\/span><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This conference is a fantastic opportunity for those young people, who are heavily politically engaged but currently are not of age to vote, to have a voice in politics and international relations. Our students learned that each of them can make a change. Through enquiry, open-mindedness and self-confidence, they will become the leaders of tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cI thought that the idea of traveling internationally for an MUN conference would be quite an effort for something that not a lot of people know about. I was proven wrong, it was completely the opposite! When we arrived, the sheer mass of people crowding into the opening ceremony was overwhelming. The organization that goes into such an event is amazing, and is certainly something we want to repeat in our own Halcyon MUN conference.\u201d Boet, Halcyon Student, Grade 10.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/bestdelegate.com\/model-un-teaches-the-10-future-skills-employers-want\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read
