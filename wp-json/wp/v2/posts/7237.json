They learnt about lots of different types of natural specimens from skulls and crystals to dinosaur fossils and butterflies. They became scientists for the day and examined the artefacts for evidence under microscopes to understand their composition and taxonomy. The learnt to accurately record and interpret data and make their own conclusions from findings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Grade 6 &#8211; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britishmuseum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>British Museum<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students spent their second Community Day at the British Museum exploring a range of Masks and Artefacts from different cultures, investigating what they were made from, who wore them and what the performer might have communicated to the audience. Using their iPads they were able to take photographs of details, which might inspire them back at school for ideas and information about specific symbols they might have found. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The afternoon session was spent orienteering in pairs in the Ancient Britain section, taking part in a Team Quest.

After taking the London Underground to Ladbroke Grove, the students took part in two different interactive workshops. The first workshop focused on Brand Evolution and how brands have had to evolve to suit changing communities and constantly changing environments. The students developed a chosen brand, showing how it could evolve even further- the results included a gold-plated, refillable bubble bath bottle and a confetti-popping scourer packaging!<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second workshop revolved around customer profiling, and how brands must consider the differing needs of multiple people within society. Students used magazines and newspapers to create the customers for their evolved product from the previous workshop. &nbsp;The students developed empathy, understanding and an appreciation for the different global communities.

The codebreaking team successfully cracked the codes of German Army administration, German Airforce and later Italian and Japanese military codes. This produced vital intelligence in support of Allied military operations on land, at sea and in the air during World War Two. Students explored the restored codebreaking huts and learned the story of the codebreaking teams, 75% of whom were women. &nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-9533 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/2990765\/Imported_Blog_Media\/https_2F2Fhistoricroyalpalaces_picturepark.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"833\" height=\"555\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>Grade 9 &#8211; <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrp.org.uk\/tower-of-london\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Tower of London<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grade 9 explored the Tower of London; a secure fortress, royal palace and infamous prison.
