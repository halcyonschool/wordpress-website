Incorporating interactive features into the museum as a tool of showcasing the day-to-day brutality of slave labour, visitors were able to attempt using some of the manual work tools themselves: for example, students were able to experience how difficult it was to raise a bucket using a hand-controlled wheel, even without water. The exhibition powerfully communicated the normalisation of brutality against enslaved African men, women, and children.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>History around the world: welcoming diverse perspectives<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As an international school in London, we are grateful to hear a variety of cultural perspectives in classroom discussions on a daily basis. This greatly enriches the learning of both students and teachers &#8211; and we are always pleased to have the opportunity to welcome visitors to Halcyon that can support us in investigating diverse corners of history.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our students benefited from Dr Eva Thorne&#8217;s visit to Halcyon, who brought with her fascinating insights into the background of the civil rights movement in the United States from a personal perspective, including her own family&#8217;s experiences as a reference point. Topics discussed housing redlining, the 1944 &#8216;G.I. Bill&#8217; (which excluded black veterans from receiving certain benefits on their return from war), the impact of bus boycotts, and more. We look forward to sharing our students&#8217; thoughts on this fascinating unit as we go forward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/unnamed-2022-03-15T145542.661-1024x528.jpg\" alt=\"DEI class discussion\" class=\"wp-image-12451\" width=\"1262\" height=\"651\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/unnamed-2022-03-15T145542.661-1024x528.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/unnamed-2022-03-15T145542.661-300x155.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/unnamed-2022-03-15T145542.661-768x396.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/unnamed-2022-03-15T145542.661-600x309.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/unnamed-2022-03-15T145542.661.jpg 1160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1262px) 100vw, 1262px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Embracing agency: analysing and designing campaigns<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The International Baccalaureate\u2019s mission is to develop \u201cinquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world\u201d.
