We are very excited to expand this integral part of our school counselling service, as students consider both their educational and careers options for the future.<\/p>\n<p>Students will have the opportunity to choose a&nbsp;work experience placement, which should be a minimum of two days but could extend to the full five days. There will be no G10 classes that week. During the final week of the school year, students will attend IB Diploma preparation classes.<\/p>\n<p>We launched the Work Experience Week during our G10 Careers Day Wednesday 3 October. Throughout the year, the University and Careers Guidance Counsellor, Dr Mark Bowen, will help the G10 students consider what career areas they would like to explore further. This will guide students toward a decision about their preferred work placement in June.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;As well as providing an opportunity for you to enhance your skills and knowledge, work experience can help you clarify your career goals.&#8221; This year, we are pleased to announce that we will be offering G10 students a Work Experience Week at the end of this academic year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":7298,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[37,57],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7242"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7242"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7242\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7359,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7242\/revisions\/7359"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7298"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7242"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7242"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7242"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
