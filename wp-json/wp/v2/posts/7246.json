Each of our students was awarded the IB Diploma \u2013 a 100% pass rate \u2013 with an average score of 35 points. Further, 90% of students scored over 30 points, and 20% scored over 40 points. While this is our second year of IBDP examinations, it does include some Halcyon firsts; our first graduate going on to medical school; our first Ivy League placement; our first graduate to gain a place at a highly-competitive performance arts programme; and the first Halcyon student going to an Australian university.<\/p>\n<p>Our school mission asks us to focus on the individual student and ensure that we realise their full potential. Therefore, examination results should be about acknowledging and celebrating the many different, individual successes.<\/p>\n<p>On behalf of everyone in the Halcyon School community, I would like to share our warmest congratulations with the Class of 2018, and send our very best wishes to each of them as they open exciting new chapters in their lives.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/2990765\/Imported_Blog_Media\/bma%20sig.jpg\" alt=\"bma sig\" width=\"137\"><\/p>\n<p>Barry Mansfield<br \/>\nDirector<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Congratulations to the Class of 2018!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":7302,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[37],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7246"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7246"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7246\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7491,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7246\/revisions\/7491"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7302"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7246"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7246"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7246"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
