As we continue our <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/remote-learning\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Remote Learning<\/a> platform, we have enjoyed hearing wonderful stories from our virtual classrooms, as well as from the thriving digital clubs and Wellbeing spaces that our students and teachers have created together.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<div id=\"hs_cos_wrapper_module_15850731861684\" class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_widget hs_cos_wrapper_type_module\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"widget\" data-hs-cos-type=\"module\">\n<div id=\"hs_cos_wrapper_module_15850731861684_\" class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_widget hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"widget\" data-hs-cos-type=\"rich_text\">\n<p>Although Grade 7 students participated in their afternoon Wellbeing session in separate rooms, they were reminded of their connection as a community as they explored an interactive map of London together online.<\/p>\n<p>Mr Harvey, our Restorative Justice Practitioner, set students the task of discovering more about London\u2019s history, transport and culture through news articles and informational videos that were placed around different landmarks. Students then returned to the Google Meet classroom, where Mr Harvey prompted students with questions on details of the Hatton Gardens Robbery, London Underground Journeys and even Mr Cann\u2019s houseboat.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Students were excited to share that they had discovered brand-new information about their own neighbourhoods that stretched all the way back into the Tudor era.<\/p>\n<p>Learning more about our London community &#8211; and participating in the additional dance challenge that Mr Harvey added to the map &#8211; was a great way for Grade 7 to connect with each other across our virtual community whilst helping them understand more about their local area.<\/p>\n<p>Like our teachers, our students recognise the need for our community to connect with one another beyond their virtual classrooms. <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/extracurricular-activities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Extra-Curricular Activities<\/a> are often a much-anticipated time for our students to come together and share their unique interests, and Greta, Juliette and Nicole have ensured that Dance Club participants still have the chance to come to their regular Monday slot via Google Meet!<\/p>\n<p>Joined by new attendees, as well as members of staff, the Grade 11 Dance Club leaders led us through a warm-up and a dance instruction session &#8211; reminding us of the importance of being active, as well as enjoying ourselves, as we participate in school from separate rooms.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone\" style=\"background-color: transparent; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hub\/2990765\/hubfs\/ezgif-6-72bc3ba51fb1.gif?upscale=true&amp;width=910&amp;upscale=true&amp;name=ezgif-6-72bc3ba51fb1.gif\" alt=\"online dance clubs\" width=\"455\" height=\"328\" align=\"middle\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Our lunchtime clubs provide an important space for students to relax and spend time together, and Mr McGowan has ensured that our film enthusiasts can still attend <strong>Movie Club<\/strong>\u00a0virtually during lunchtimes!\u00a0<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>It is so important at this time to keep connected and geographically grounded as part of our own wellbeing as a school community.
