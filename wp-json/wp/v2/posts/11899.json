But it turned out to be really nice. The community is very welcoming; I didn\u2019t feel like a stranger when I came in on the first day.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D3_568p-1024x552.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11905\" width=\"1106\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D3_568p-1024x552.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D3_568p-300x162.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D3_568p-768x414.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D3_568p-1536x829.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D3_568p-600x324.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D3_568p.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How great teachers can make a difference to new students<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our new joiners were keen to share how enjoyable their first few months at Halcyon have been. Getting involved in classroom activities and extra-curriculars can be a big step after moving school &#8211; but, as Sayuri and Yara explained, dynamic lessons and inspiring teaching can make a big difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery lesson sparks new discussions and ideas, which is exciting,\u201d reflected Sayuri. \u201cThe teachers aren\u2019t afraid of having fun, too &#8211; everyone feels equal.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe school really encourages students to express what they think and how they feel about what they learn. It feels very free,\u201d added Yara, \u201cwhich is really important at school &#8211; it\u2019s a happier place to be because of that. It really boosts students\u2019 self-confidence to feel listened to like this.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sayuri agreed, adding that \u201cthis makes us really want to engage in things outside of class &#8211; like extra-curricular activities.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_300-2-e1642675814245-1024x676.jpg\" alt=\"girl playing scrabble\" class=\"wp-image-11903\" width=\"1100\" height=\"726\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_300-2-e1642675814245-1024x676.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_300-2-e1642675814245-300x198.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_300-2-e1642675814245-768x507.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_300-2-e1642675814245-600x396.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_300-2-e1642675814245.jpg 1324w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making new friends: finding connection through difference<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that one of the most important aspects of moving school is making friends &#8211; especially when you have recently moved to a new country, like many of Halcyon\u2019s newest students. As a small international community which is comprised of over 30 nationalities, every student brings an exciting wealth of experiences, cultural insights, and stories to Halcyon\u2019s campus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can always find someone who you can get on with; someone who understands you well,\u201d explained Sayuri.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked both students to tell us their favourite thing about Halcyon, and (after turning to Yara with a smile to say \u2018you\u2019, which received an \u2018aw\u2019 and a warm hug), they settled on the diversity of both our curriculum and our community.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe things we learn are often presented from really different perspectives, and different people in class add their own thoughts into the discussion too, so we get to expand our world through learning. It\u2019s this kind of diversity in the school that really enriches my education,\u201d answered Sayuri.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yara too reflected on the diversity of interests and intellectual pursuits that energise the school community.<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to stop students expressing what they\u2019re really interested in, so the environment feels really open-minded and understanding,\u201d she shared.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re so pleased to hear that our students have had a wonderful first term at Halcyon &#8211; and we&#8217;re excited to welcome more!
