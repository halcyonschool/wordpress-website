As an International Baccalaureate school, we commit to the mission of producing \u201cyoung people who help to create a better and more peaceful world\u201d &#8211; and being able to think critically and reflectively about the experiences they encounter through life will support our students in fulfilling this goal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cognitive Coaching &#8211; a process in which a trained Cognitive Coach leads a coachee through a structured reflective or planning conversation &#8211; encourages students, the coachees, to become critical thinkers and problem solvers. When a student wishes to discuss a problem they find challenging, the Cognitive Coach does not aim to present a solution, or explain why the problem occurred &#8211; instead, the Cognitive Coach asks meditative questions that guide the student in exploring causal factors, perspectives, and strategies for the future on their own behalf.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cognitive Coaching enables us to maintain a healthy and balanced approach to problem-solving not only as we navigate education and our careers, but also in situations that impact our personal wellbeing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cognitive development can be life-changing for young people and adults alike.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enabling teachers to improve their pedagogic practice through coaching<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our teachers seek to be the best that they can &#8211; and so do our students. through asking learners questions in the right way, our teachers are adept at building young persons\u2019 capacity for self-assessment, bringing them to find their own strengths and weaknesses instead of relying on reports.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond evaluating a student\u2019s work, providing an opinion on their progress, or inferring something about their attitude to work, our teachers encourage students to do this themselves. Teachers make observations and ask reflective questions about students\u2019 work to prompt a higher level of thinking &#8211; and we\u2019re pleased to say that this is a successful approach in the classroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does this look like? Instead of saying \u201cGood job!\u201d or \u201cDo you think you could improve you time management skills?\u201d, our teachers might say: \u201cHow do you think that went?\u201d or \u201cYou didn\u2019t complete the task in the time given.\u201d Driving young people to make their own evaluations and conclusions prepares them to be impactful, self-driven individuals in the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being trained in the art of questioning extends to tone of voice, too, ensuring that our students feel welcome and encouraged to reflect on their progress &#8211; being an approachable educator &#8211; is paramount for our classroom teachers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-06T093704.453-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13914\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-06T093704.453-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-06T093704.453-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-06T093704.453-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-06T093704.453-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-06T093704.453-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-06T093704.453.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Producing self-directed learners with a stronger sense of wellbeing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Cognitive Coaching conversation, coaches pose questions and guide coachees in a deliberate, directed, and targeted way to support them in becoming the best that they can be.<br><br>Coaches seek to develop within their coachees the five \u2018States of Mind\u2019: Consciousness, Interdependence, Efficacy, Flexibility, and Craftmanship.
