English and English Plus (EAL) teacher Lindsey Fairweather is not alone in her excitement to share <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/remote-learning\" rel=\"noopener\">Halcyon\u2019s Remote Learning platform<\/a> &#8211; parents have described the school\u2019s digital transition as an \u201cexceptional\u201d response that has students \u201c100% focused and engaged\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Halcyon launched its Remote Learning platform on Monday 16 March &#8211; a week prior to most schools in the United Kingdom. In preparation, our teachers worked together with Digital Learning <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tes.com\/news\/revealed-stars-uks-edtech-sector\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leader<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jnealeuk\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Neale<\/a> to build a virtual learning platform, online classrooms, community resources, as well as collaborative staff planning spaces. This multi-layered approach to remote learning reflects a shared understanding of how to use EdTech at Halcyon: not selecting apps for isolated classroom tasks, or because of \u201cbells and whistles\u201d (as Jon puts it), but integrating tools ranging from Google Hangouts Meet to <a href=\"https:\/\/cospaces.io\/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cospaces<\/a> to deliver online classes that engage each and every student as equal participants.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>From the first day of Remote Learning, Halcyon\u2019s teachers have connected with us through Google Meet to share their insights into how educators can build an interactive, inclusive community through digital tools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Using EdTech to create interactive learning experiences<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Halcyon understands that Remote Learning is an opportunity for educators to do much more than instruct over video-conferencing &#8211; instead, we can integrate digital tools to engage our students and connect them across virtual classrooms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/2990765\/3-1.png\" alt=\"3-1\" width=\"390\" style=\"width: 390px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\">On the very first day of Halcyon\u2019s transition to Remote Learning, IBMYP Science and IBDP Environmental Systems and Societies teacher Martyn Steiner was eager to share the success of using <a href=\"https:\/\/nearpod.com\/international\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nearpod<\/a> as a platform for his lesson. Grade 8 engaged in their lesson on the causes and effects of climate change through a \u2018Livedeck\u2019 of interactive slides, which included a Virtual Reality tour of a UK flood and a live \u2018open-ended quiz\u2019, where students thoughtfully shared possible answers to its causes. Martyn suggested that being able to receive students\u2019 responses and provide feedback on Google Classroom in real time made the Google Meet room feel \u201cjust like a real Halcyon classroom\u201d &#8211; an environment where each student can receive personalised attention and guidance from teachers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Across our team, teachers have showcased a plethora of ways of using Google Meet to effectively encourage participation from all students. IBDP Mathematics Teacher Sonja Bartholomew invited us to take a look into her remote version of a Higher Level lesson, where she used <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gingerlabs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Notability<\/a> to work through optimisation problems on a virtual iPad whiteboard, shared with her two students through the app\u2019s \u2018Present\u2019 function. Students were able to comment on Sonja\u2019s optimisation problems in real time, as well as respond to each other\u2019s suggestions.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/2990765\/2-1.png\" alt=\"2-1\" width=\"416\" style=\"background-color: transparent; width: 416px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\">Sonja\u2019s peer-evaluative approach was also reflected in Anne Liao\u2019s and Kerry Jenkins\u2019 online Grade 7 Science classes. Anne and Kerry integrated <a href=\"https:\/\/info.flipgrid.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FlipGrid<\/a> into their Google Meet lessons as a way for their students to upload their home refraction experiments to a shared platform. Through examining each others\u2019 experiments and engaging in peer review through Google Classroom, Grade 7 participated in an enriching learning experience that also reinforced their connection with one another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In our video call, Lindsey recalled how establishing the rule of typing \u2018Q\u2019 into the Hangouts chat to ask a question had encouraged students to recognise the Meet room as a shared space: Grade 6 quickly became conscientious of other students\u2019 needs, even speaking up to remind one another to \u201cstay hydrated\u201d as they learned. It is this community-oriented environment that allows our teachers to successfully deliver a range of independent and team learning tasks &#8211; including Grade 6\u2019s Shakespeare group performances, planned for later in the term.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Building a digital community beyond online classrooms<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCreating a Remote Learning Environment is primarily about all of us being able to work together to build a spirit of community,\u201d explains Jon Neale, responding to our questions over voice chat. \u201cThis means integrating digital tools into student life beyond lessons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Halcyon\u2019s Wellbeing team have come together to create an inclusive online community that extends far beyond virtual classrooms. Student Wellbeing Leader Toby Cann has used \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinglink.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thinglink<\/a>\u2019 to create an online interactive map of the school, where students could find \u201ca variety of ways to access the support that they might need.\u201d At lunch, students can use this resource to venture through virtual corridors to an art room, a music room, and spaces where they could reach out to teachers, or even simply spend time socialising with classmates. In the Stern Hall, they can access a FlipGrid dedicated to workout videos, which Staff Wellbeing Project Leader Celeste Gardner described as an initiative that allows the community \u201cto feel connected\u201d with one another. \u201cEncouraging everyone to share their workout tips on FlipGrid brings us together, while also providing a way for us to look after our physical wellbeing.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Celeste\u2019s recognition of the need for a supportive community in these times is reflected by our students. Nicole, Greta and Juliette (Grade 11) have continued to lead Dance Club through Google Meet on Mondays, with the welcome addition of some new attendees; creating another space for students to connect beyond their virtual classrooms.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/2990765\/ezgif-6-72bc3ba51fb1.gif\" alt=\"dance club\" width=\"389\" style=\"width: 389px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Our Director\u2019s daily communication with our community provides a place for students, staff and parents to stay updated with virtual events while gaining insight into innovative online classes. It\u2019s important to find ways for our families to feel connected to this transition process &#8211; and parents as well as students can find \u201cstructure\u201d to daily life through a regular stream of information (as one parent described).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Going above and beyond: a community of lifelong learners<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a Science team, we\u2019re continuing to meet within our regular slots through Google Meet. We\u2019re also able to facilitate thorough one-on-one planning with our Grade subject co-teachers.\u201d MYP Science and DP Physics teacher Anders Henriksen explains. Collaborative GSuite tools can be used to facilitate coherent lesson planning that guides students clearly towards their learning objectives, even in these unusual circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/2990765\/DSC05462%20(1).jpg\" alt=\"DSC05462 (1)\" width=\"5472\" style=\"width: 5472px;\"><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As well as using Google Meet and collaborative Google Docs to share ideas among teams, our teachers use a staff-wide \u2018Q&amp;A\u2019 document to source their colleagues\u2019 suggestions and thoughts on their ideas. Jon Neale stresses the importance of \u201cbeing as transparent and open as possible\u201d in working through the transition to a remote learning: a fundamental part of striving to create an ever-improving digital environment for our students.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re ready for new families to join our thriving digital community &#8211; register for a <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/visit\" rel=\"noopener\">virtual Open House<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the cheerful noise of the Google Hangouts Meet connection rings out, we\u2019re faced by a smiling teacher in her living room who eagerly awaits the prompt to tell us all about her virtual lesson.
