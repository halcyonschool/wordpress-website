It has been wonderful to see our students flourish alongside our school community &#8211; and Ms Al-Shammari shares our pride for the growth of this group of young people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have never worked with a class that has such a variety of talent and expertise,\u201d reflected Ms Al-Shammari. \u201cFrom future vets, to doctors, to engineers, and leaders &#8211; as well as politicians, economists, and global thinkers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey have continued to strive for more, and have gone beyond what is expected of them. This group is going to make a difference in the world, and have received amazing offers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms Al-Shammari explained that some of our students\u2019 offers were particularly impressive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas (Grade 12) received an offer to study a World Bachelor of Business from the University of Southern California (USC). \u2018\u201cThis is a highly competitive and highly coveted programme that only takes what they describe as the \u2018cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\u2019. It\u2019s fantastic that he received an offer,\u201d shared Ms Al-Shammari.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our students are heading to destinations that range from the University of St Andrews in Scotland to the University of Toronto in Canada to study courses including Medicine, International Economics and Finance, Mechanical Engineering, Film Production, Veterinary Science, Politics, and much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>IB University Prospects: skills and experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme is certainly a challenge &#8211; a challenge that ensures students are encouraged to develop the high-level skills they will need at university and beyond.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Personal Statements and other elements of a university application, \u201cthe academic rigour and readiness that students have shines through by itself,\u201d explained Ms Al-Shammari. Studying six demanding subjects and \u201cjuggling the rigour of the programme alongside all the other requirements the Diploma has\u201d isn\u2019t an easy feat, and indicates a student\u2019s diligence and capability from the very beginning of an application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/success\/university-and-careers-counselling\/\">University and Careers Counselling<\/a> Director lightheartedly added that she didn\u2019t \u201chave to work particularly hard to get students to show their skills &#8211; there\u2019s always examples of organisation, leadership, and time management in the Diploma.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_360-3-1024x482.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12705\" width=\"1118\" height=\"526\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_360-3-1024x482.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_360-3-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_360-3-768x361.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_360-3-1536x723.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_360-3-600x282.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_360-3.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1118px) 100vw, 1118px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>IB University Prospects: working with the wider world<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another requirement of universities includes a student\u2019s demonstration of passion and genuine interest in their field of study &#8211; something that is nurtured by the varied requirements of the Diploma Programme&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTheir CAS programme has definitely proved to be a fruitful ground to develop care and interest in events and processes within the global community.\u201d said Ms-Al Shammari.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>\u201cThey\u2019ve been able to authentically engage in issues that impact their world, and this also feeds into their academic success .Their Extended Essays have proved to be the pinnacle of their applications, especially to UK universities, to demo`nstrate that authentic engagement in key issues relating to the subject they want to study at a higher level.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ms Al-Shammari concluded that the Diploma Programme\u2019s Extended Essay is \u201cso interdisciplinary that there will always be a connection between \u201cwhat [students] want to study at university\u201d and their choice of topic.
