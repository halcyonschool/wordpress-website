While we make every effort to make our community close, Grade 7 are unlikely to have had the chance to familiarise themselves with IBDP teachers and our Administration team. \u2018Halcyon Who?\u2019, however, is making this happen. Each Grade 7 student has been provided with the task of designing a unique product for an assigned staff member, based on a problem that they would like to tackle in their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Asking Grade 7 students to design bespoke products for these members of our community is a social and academic challenge &#8211; but Chloe MacBean\u2019s class has grasped this personal learning opportunity with both hands. Ms MacBean took a moment to explain the many ways in which \u2018Halcyon Who?\u2019 is enriching students\u2019 social and personal learning journeys.<\/p>\n<p>Developing an understanding of another\u2019s needs requires students to take a responsible approach to communication with others. Adopting the right tone for an email can be a struggle, even for adults, but students used Ms MacBean\u2019s help to introduce themselves appropriately and design carefully targeted questionnaires for their in-school customers. In this way, \u2018Halcyon Who?\u2019 adds to the many pathways that students in our school take on their social learning journey.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, this project encourages our students to expand the boundaries of their creativity: students\u2019 design solutions range from an app for finding a new place to live, to a handheld Apple charger storage case. Grade 7 are taking their physical and digital toolkit outside of the box to craft model solutions to staff members\u2019 daily inconveniences.<\/p>\n<p>The freedom that students are encouraged to take in the design classroom reflects a core aspect of Halcyon\u2019s learning programme. Instead of learning a fixed list of design possibilities, Ms MacBean\u2019s students are encouraged to develop an understanding of the design <i>process <\/i>&#8211; independently finding their way from the problem to the final solution. At Halcyon, we believe in building students\u2019 capability to tackle problems head-on beginning in Grade 6. The IB MYP Personal Projects and IB DP Extended Essays in Grade 10 and 11 will demand well-developed project management skills from students &#8211; so why wait until then?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just academia that requires these skills: it\u2019s life itself. Facing challenges and developing solutions is an inevitable requirement for all of us. We recognise this.<\/p>\n<p>The social and problem-solving skills developed in \u2018Halcyon Who?\u2019 are mirrored by our extensive Wellbeing Programme.
