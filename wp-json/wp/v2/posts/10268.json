As we reach our eighth year as a school and our fifth graduating class, we are proud to see that our community is reaching new heights in pioneering education. Our teachers continue to showcase their commitment to innovation in respect to academic attainment, extra-curricular provision, and social and emotional learning. Together, we are launching our new Robotics Programme, and our Wellbeing Team continues to engage in new research, with our students participating in a Cambridge\/UCL Blakemore Lab study on how to positively harness peer-influenced decision-making.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all possible because of the combined mission shared by our staff, parents, and students: to draw out the unique potential of each student. All of our resources are channelled into providing an ever-improving learning environment for our students: we recruit the most committed teachers, and provide our educators with the responsibility and opportunity to pursue new ideas in the classroom. Our Sustainability Project Leader has challenged the boundaries of what sustainability policy looks like in schools, working with our teachers to embed a focus on the natural world into the curriculum in all subjects, from measuring Hyde Park\u2019s tree density in Mathematics to discussing different views on the anthropocene in English. Our teaching team has taken IB Service into every area of the curriculum, inspiring our students to reflect on what they can do to create a better world. Our Community Partnership project has launched with our \u2018Knowledge in the Service of Social Justice\u2019 speaker event; this inspired students, parents, and staff alike to think about how we can best serve our world. While we have not been able to meet our local educational community as much as we would like to this year, our Model United Nations students have strived to bring issues of global concern into the classroom, inviting local state and independent schools to a virtual edition of our annual Halcyon-hosted MUN Conference, this year with the theme of Accessibility to Education.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best International School<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The achievements of our growing group of alumni shine a light on how everyone in our small international community is nurturing students to go out into the world as thoughtful, internationally-minded changemakers. To name a few examples from the Class of 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/profile-3\/\">Sabrina<\/a> has explored how fashion embodies global and urban identities as editor-in-chief of UCL\u2019s MODO magazine, and <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/profile-1\/\">Isaac<\/a> has hosted his own art exhibitions which encourage viewers to think more closely about the individuals they encounter everyday.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back on our journey, we can say that &#8211; in the face of opportunities, innovation, and challenges &#8211; our small international community has drawn on our united strength to deliver an outstanding, ever-improving educational experience for young people that has led us to be nominated as Best International School.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We look forward to sharing further news with you soon!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/class-of-2021-ib-diploma-results\/\">Class of 2021 IB Diploma Results<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wellbeing-team-cambridge-ucl\/\">Blakemore Lab visit: Cambridge and UCL researchers work with our Wellbeing Team<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--[if lte IE 8]>\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2-legacy.js\"><\/script>\n<![endif]-->\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2.js\"><\/script>\n<script>\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n\tregion: \"na1\",\n\tportalId: \"2990765\",\n\tformId: \"db130e02-0e7d-4d18-9c03-c23e70a22958\"\n});\n<\/script>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are pleased to share with our community that we have been listed as a finalist for the following Independent School of the Year Award: Best International School.
