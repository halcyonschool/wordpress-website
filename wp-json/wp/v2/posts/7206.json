We have so many options &#8211; we don\u2019t have to \u2018bulk up\u2019 on beans or cheese to replace meat. We can ensure that students get their carbohydrates and protein in a range of ways!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Establishing the importance of Halcyon\u2019s sustainable approach to forming healthy dietary habits. \u201cAs a vegetarian school, we find that meat alternatives can be made from many nutritious, high-quality ingredients &#8211; and we create 90% of the dishes from scratch. We make our own vegetarian burgers!\u201d \u201cStudents might be surprised that we can produce such variety, but this is all part of helping them understand that there\u2019s always plenty of ways to eat healthily.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2>Incorporating student preferences<\/h2>\n<p>Our catering team is keen to express that another crucial aspect of her role is actively seeking out student opinion. \u201cYou have to respect the tastes of the people you cater for,; and I value dislikes as much as compliments. Constructive criticism is the only way to change!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When we tentatively ask about the question of \u2018picky eaters\u2019, she laughs, clearly at ease with dealing with particular tastes. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be people who are more picky with their food, and we\u2019d love to have a chat with those students just as much as everyone else. We let them know that we understand, and that there\u2019s always something else they can have. We can always try new changes in the menus that are responsive to students\u2019 ideas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Prompted by the discussion of student inclusivity, we ask the team about the importance of including catering in our school fees. \u201cIf students had to pay, they wouldn\u2019t feel that they\u2019re the priority and they wouldn\u2019t want to communicate with us to find a healthy way of eating that suits them.\u201d As well as lunch, Halcyon provides snack breaks included in the school <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/2018\/03\/school-fees\/\" rel=\" noopener\">fees<\/a> &#8211; we want our students to know that their health and energy is our absolute priority.<\/p>\n<h2>A dedicated team<\/h2>\n<p>Like our teaching and administrative teams, our catering team is guided by a collaborative spirit that enables a shared positivity and determination. \u201cThe most important thing we learned is to value each other.\u201d The canteen wouldn\u2019t be able to function without all of us working together respecting the structures and routines of every member of the team.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet our Catering Team!
