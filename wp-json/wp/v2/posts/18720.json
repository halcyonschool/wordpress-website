The prospect of working in an international, innovative, and entirely digital school sparked excitement in Stephanie. &#8220;It sounded really exciting,&#8221; she recalls. Little did she know that this decision would mark the beginning of her role as a pioneering teacher at Halcyon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Stephanie settled into her role and took on the additional responsibility of Creativity, Activity, and Service (CAS) Coordinator, she found joy in working in a small school environment. &#8220;I enjoyed working in a small school where I got to see the students as individuals,&#8221; she reflects. This close-knit setting allowed her to witness students developing their passions independently, fostering a sense of individual growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halcyon&#8217;s commitment to innovation extended beyond the confines of the classroom, and Stephanie highlights the impact of school-wide residential trips, Model United Nations conferences, and Global Issues Network conference events. These experiences were more than just excursions; they were opportunities for students to collaborate, build confidence as public speakers, and engage in meaningful and practical learning opportunities. &#8220;[With these opportunities] I could see how Halcyon was going to be quite innovative in using experiential learning and collaboration as a learning focus,&#8221; Stephanie notes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflecting on her first day at Halcyon, Stephanie vividly recalls setting up everything from scratch alongside a passionate group of educators and administrators. The excitement of collaborative curriculum building set the tone for Halcyon\u2019s pillars: innovation, collaboration and community. &#8220;It was a really, really exciting time,&#8221; she reminisces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, residing on a sailing boat in Colombia, Stephanie tutors students and even supervises some Halcyon History Extended Essays remotely using Starlink satellite internet. Whilst her journey has taken her to unexpected places, Halcyon&#8217;s influence is evident as she incorporates EdTech techniques learned at the school into her current work. &#8220;Halcyon really inspired me to use technology and the EdTech techniques that I learned while at Halcyon,&#8221; Stephanie affirms, showcasing the enduring impact of her time as a teacher at Halcyon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From her sailing boat in Columbia Stephanie Cooke, Halcyon\u2019s first International Baccalaureate (IB) History and Individuals &amp; Societies Teacher, shares her reflections on the exciting time she joined Halcyon and the lasting impact the school&#8217;s innovative approach to learning, particularly EdTech, has had on her career.
