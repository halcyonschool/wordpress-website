We understand that by engaging with diverse ideas, perspectives, cultures, and people, our school creates the conditions for meaningful change, both personally and socially. To diversify our curriculum &#8211; every learning moment, every day &#8211; we should be able to learn and teach so as to \u2018<em>acknowledge the variety of characteristics and categories of identity that make people unique, including but not limited to, physical, social, and other characteristics (such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, socioeconomic status, age, physical, mental and learning abilities, religious beliefs, and political beliefs).\u2019<span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/em>(Facing History and Ourselves*, 2020).<\/p>\n<p>We are also questioning every other area of our school operations &#8211;<span>&nbsp;<\/span><strong>governance,<\/strong><span>&nbsp;<\/span><strong>admissions, human resources, community engagement, and finance and facilities<\/strong><span>&nbsp;<\/span>&#8211; to understand how we might better reflect the diversity of the world around us. We are pleased to be able to share with you that we have active working groups in each of these key places, and we would also like to<strong><span>&nbsp;<\/span>invite current and alumni parents, and alumni students<\/strong><span>&nbsp;<\/span>to be involved in these projects, especially if you feel that you have some relevant expertise to support us.
