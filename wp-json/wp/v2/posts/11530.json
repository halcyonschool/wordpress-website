Every student in the United Kingdom is taught about the causes of climate change, different forms of energy, greenhouse gases, global recycling processes, and more. But is this enough to equip young people to take the lead on solving complex, global issues relating to energy and the climate, which often involve varying interests, opinions, and cultural perspectives?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sustainability education to truly prepare our students for the future, we need to give them the opportunity to apply every area of their learning to the climate emergency &#8211; from statistics in mathematics to communication in language acquisition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is sustainability in education?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, our Sustainability Project Leader, Martyn Steiner, took the lead on London Live to press the need to embed climate education into our curriculum. Martyn explained that it&#8217;s &#8220;context, not content&#8221; that we need &#8211; for example, or analysing the campaigns of green charities and politics in English.&nbsp;Watch the interview on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.londonlive.co.uk\/news\/putting-climate-change-on-the-curriculum\/?utm_campaign=Halcyon%20Happenings&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=2&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_mjEYWhTTmw-gO7jo2CvXJhLUdOSTur1RO08zG2L4tQoWZ4jn8MM-StqtvpUxyhS-wN0eLl0kN72Fs_wf6CwF-6IumDw&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_source=hs_email\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">London Live<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unnamed-54-1024x576.png\" alt=\"sustainability education news\" class=\"wp-image-11535\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unnamed-54-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unnamed-54-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unnamed-54-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unnamed-54-600x338.png 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/unnamed-54.png 1159w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beyond science: empowering students to use their voice<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Subjects from English to History can be used as catalysts for talking about global change.

As engaged global citizens, our young learners find that MUN is an excellent way to find out about new perspectives and practice problem-solving &#8211; and putting themselves in the position of COP26 delegates is a great opportunity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During our mock COP26 conference, students took the position of nations to discuss an agreement for transitioning to a cleaner global economy. The session featured a strong discussion of MEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries) honouring their commitments to LEDCs, particularly in the area of developing policy around fossil fuels, coal, and the transition to green energy. By selecting nations to lobby and nations to ally with, our students showed an impressive awareness of the impact of international inequality. We applaud our students, Mr Ashraf, and Ms Lodhi on this insightful conference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More about pioneering education at Halcyon<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/ib-sustainability-earth-day\/\">How the IB prepares us for a sustainable future: Earth Day at Halcyon<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/cognitive-coaching\/\">Cognitive Coaching: our Director explains our unique programme to TES<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/edtech-digital-technology\/\">EdTech: Our Director Argues For A New Approach in UK Schools<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/what-is-wellbeing\/\">What is wellbeing?
