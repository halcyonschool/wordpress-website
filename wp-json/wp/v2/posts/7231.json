As adults, we need to commit to the same expectations, so we come together to improve our curriculum through a collaborative, design-led, approach. The workshop, therefore, helps us to innovate &#8211; create fresh ideas and approaches &#8211; and build our community at Halcyon through collaboration. Finally, all the learning routines and skills of a Design Thinking approach will be brought to the classroom next year, for the students to try.<\/em>\u201d Barry Mansfield, Director at Halcyon.<\/p>\n<p>Design Thinking refers to the creative strategies designers use during the process of designing. It has also been developed as an approach to resolve issues outside of professional design practice, such as in business and social contexts.
