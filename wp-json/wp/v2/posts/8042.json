As always, our students demonstrated their interest in participating in Halcyon\u2019s vibrant and engaging school life: the leaders of Extra-Curricular Activities such as Halcyonite and Eco-Committee shared their plans to operate clubs virtually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><h2>Cultivating a culture of creativity: Student Council competitions<\/h2><\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"448\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/unnamed-12-1024x448.jpg\" alt=\"student council competition\" class=\"wp-image-8050\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/unnamed-12-1024x448.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/unnamed-12-600x262.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/unnamed-12-300x131.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/unnamed-12-768x336.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/unnamed-12.jpg 1160w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>As one means of connecting each grade group online, the Student Council organised dynamic daily competitions through the Goosechase App: a way for students to connect across different grade groups to combine their talents in response to different briefs. Activities are released daily, and each team is awarded points for their ongoing participation. Briefs included creative tasks such \u201cDesign a rocket with your team name on it!\u201d and \u201cReenact a scene from your favourite movie!\u201d &#8211; prompts that require our students to be resourceful at home!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p><h2>Nurturing a platform of feedback to our teachers<\/h2><\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The Student Council regularly communicates student initiatives to our teachers in order to encourage further engagement and activity &#8211; and their commitment to advocacy has shone in a variety of ways on campus as well as online. In a weekly staff meeting with our teachers, the Student Council were able to introduce their plans for amplifying students\u2019 voices and share some of their peers\u2019 thoughts on the curriculum. Teachers listened carefully, and provided feedback and additional suggestions on how to implement these ideas into the classroom.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis was a really valuable and unique opportunity that I don\u2019t think we would have had if we were in another school,\u201d shared Maya, co-head of Student Voice. In this session, Leo, Maya, Sofia, Mina, and Thomas presented plans that ranged from gathering lunch menu suggestions to seeking classroom activity feedback.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p><h2>Embracing accountability: presenting ideas to our parent community<\/h2><\/p>\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, our Student Council joined our online Evening with the Board event to share some insights on student life at Halcyon with the community. Held on the same online platform as Halcyon\u2019s <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/visit\">Virtual Open Houses <\/a>and attended by over 50 families, this event included live Q&amp;As and presented an opportunity for parents to speak to our Board of Trustees and Senior Leadership Team.The Student Council enjoyed presenting their ideas for remote assemblies and student participation in teacher interview panels with our parents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/student-life\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Student Life at Halcyon<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<strong>Subscribe to hear more updates on our curriculum, facilities, team and more:<strong>\u00a0\n<!--[if lte IE 8]>\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2-legacy.js\"><\/script>\n<![endif]-->\n<script charset=\"utf-8\" type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/js.hsforms.net\/forms\/v2.js\"><\/script>\n<script>\n  hbspt.forms.create({\n\tportalId: \"2990765\",\n\tformId: \"db130e02-0e7d-4d18-9c03-c23e70a22958\"\n});\n<\/script>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Student autonomy is central to life at Halcyon: empowering students to take ownership of their learning and advocate for their passions is part of preparing them to be the \u201cleaders of tomorrow\u201d (Ofsted).&nbsp; &nbsp; As we learn from home, Halcyon\u2019s Student Council is playing a key role in ensuring that students also have the opportunity [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":8043,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[37,57],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8042"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=8042"}],"version-history":[{"count":10,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8042\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":10725,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/8042\/revisions\/10725"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/8043"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=8042"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=8042"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=8042"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
