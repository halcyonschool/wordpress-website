Together, these experts performed for our students and led an in-depth question and answer session.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Halcyon students &#8211; many of whom are embarking on their own music projects through our facilities &#8211; were quick to recognise the magnitude of this opportunity, and excitedly queried Mr Themis about how to succeed in the music industry. \u201cIt\u2019s all about practice,\u201d he responded. \u201cImagine that you\u2019ve just finished reading a sheet of Mozart\u2019s music. That doesn\u2019t mean you can suddenly play it on the piano,\u201d he reminds our students. \u201cYou have to practice performing, practice singing, practice playing.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At Halcyon, we recognise the importance of practice. Our IB <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibo.org\/programmes\/diploma-programme\/curriculum\/the-arts\/music\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Music Curriculum<\/a> and on-demand provision of instrumental lessons provides students with a space to enhance their skills.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Practice makes perfect: watch our students\u2019 performances<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At Mr Themis\u2019 suggestion, several of Halcyon\u2019s students confidently took to the stage to deliver performances of their own.
