Firstly, the mandatory six subjects &#8211; spanning a range of academic fields and disciplines, ensuring students engage with both the humanities, sciences, languages and arts &#8211; allows students to explore their academic interests. The range can help students solidify the subject which they want to study at university, and discover their personality as a learner.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe additional core requirements, such as the Extended Essay, also allows students to not only write a first, extensive research piece resembling a dissertation, but also explore an area of interest. Furthermore, the amount of work that comes from having six subjects and three core requirements forces students to develop their self-management skills, as well as the ability to study independently which is required for university<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DSC06865-1-2-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"lola grade 12\" class=\"wp-image-11354\" width=\"1110\" height=\"739\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DSC06865-1-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DSC06865-1-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DSC06865-1-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DSC06865-1-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DSC06865-1-2-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/DSC06865-1-2.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>IB Student Profile: Subjects<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lola studies Spanish, English Literature, and History at Higher Level &#8211; a broad and challenging programme that will prepare her for any path in higher education and beyond.
