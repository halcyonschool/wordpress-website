Some students chose to alter how many times the coil wrapped around the iron nail, for example, whereas some students chose to alter the length of the nail itself.

Although students do practise pen-and-paper graph-plotting, Vernier technologies are connected to the scientific instruments so that data is measured, updated and recorded live, automatically displaying on a table and graph type of the student\u2019s choosing. This is another way of providing students with a sense of responsibility for their own investigation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grade 8\u2019s magnetic field sensors were connected directly to the Vernier recording software, which allowed students to see the impact of their chosen variable on the progression of their data on their screens in real-time. \u201cThis helps students to understand the purpose of collecting data, and what their raw data means &#8211; they also develop their understanding of interpretation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"595\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/DSC06194-1-copy-1024x595.jpg\" alt=\"teacher and student working together\" class=\"wp-image-7978\" srcset=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/DSC06194-1-copy-1024x595.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/DSC06194-1-copy-600x349.jpg 600w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/DSC06194-1-copy-300x174.jpg 300w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/DSC06194-1-copy-768x446.jpg 768w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/DSC06194-1-copy-1536x893.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/DSC06194-1-copy.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Science in the Diploma Programme: university-readying research projects<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf a student is interested in investigating urban pollution, they can borrow carbon dioxide sensors, spirometers, and even radiation sensors &#8211; these can all reveal a huge amount about our environment,\u201d explains Tewolde, sharing some more details on the laboratory technologies available to students at Halcyon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our class of 2020&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/success\">graduate<\/a>, Nikhita, used a variety of technologies to investigate the prevalence of respiratory diseases in urban areas for her Extended Essay.

Applying these cutting-edge technologies to data collection and interpretation is a key skill for careers in science: for example, cell multiplication is measured digitally as part of vaccine research and production.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional research guidance offered to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/curriculum#dp\">Diploma Programme<\/a>&nbsp;students supports students in having the confidence to explore new horizons in their IB Extended Essays and Internal Assessments.
