Staff examined the key to successful mindfulness in schools through understanding and recognising the importance of teacher and staff self-care &#8211; highlighting that, <em>\u201cif we want to help our young people develop the skills they will need for a fruitful, balanced life, it is important that we are able to cultivate these capacities in, and for, ourselves\u201d<\/em>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For all our staff, developing self-awareness can help us connect more authentically with our students and community, manage our challenges more effectively, and make teaching more enjoyable. The workshop explored simple mindfulness techniques and practices that we can all use both in and outside of the classroom at Halcyon.<\/p>\n<p>We practised focusing our breathing, developing an awareness of our surroundings, and how external stimuli can both hinder and help our attention, and those of our students. We analysed evidence about the positive impact mindfulness can have in promoting mental health among students and staff. The team looks forward to practicing mindful teaching &#8211; using mindfulness in our classrooms to support the learning and wellbeing of both students and staff.<\/p>\n<p>Our Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education team, lead by Toby Cann, will introduce mindfulness to students through weekly PSHEE lessons. Ms Cooper will offer mindfulness sessions to Diploma students, to support them as they navigate the demands of the programme.
