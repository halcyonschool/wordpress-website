It\u2019s been really cool from a professional aspect to grow in multiple different areas during my time here. In a larger institution it might be more hierarchical, the broader staff body at Halcyon has more autonomy than other institutions, allowing for more creativity.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Interdisciplinary Units (IDUs)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key project in Kerry\u2019s portfolio is the coordination of Halcyon\u2019s Interdisciplinary Units (IDUs), which enable students to merge two subjects into real world projects. The process of elevating students beyond the means of their classroom and equipping them with meaningful, real life skills, is a part of the role Kerry is particularly passionate about delivering.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>\u201cIf we are thinking of the real world, we are never working in our own silo. The world is set up to make connections, to build upon knowledge from one skill to another. It makes sense to set students up for that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOne of the things I really like about the new IDU criteria is that students are asked about the future benefits of their projects: how they will apply this learning outside of school. The project has depth, because it blends the knowledge and skills from two subjects, to examine what they mean to you.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside her colleagues, Kerry has coordinated significant milestones in the MYP, such as securing an additional hour of MYP teaching time for all MYP students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>\u201cWe are a team that looks at what is best for each student. I\u2019m proud each student reaches their own potential in whatever capacity that might be.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Favourite Part of Working at Halcyon<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from being located next to her favourite independent coffee joint, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sofrench.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">So French<\/a>, Kerry\u2019s favourite part of working at Halcyon is the people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>\u201cHalcyon is full of people who are caring, intelligent, amazing practitioners. It\u2019s their diverse outlook on life and education. They are really reflective about the IB profile, it\u2019s what makes Halcyon a really great place to work.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m really proud we have such incredibly talented teachers &#8211; rich in expertise and passionate about their practice. I don\u2019t see anywhere else as forward thinking as Halcyon. At its heart, it\u2019s caring. It\u2019s a special place and we want to make sure every kid has the best possible experience.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/inquiry-based-learning\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/inquiry-based-learning\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kerry\u2019s blog on Inquiry-Based Learning: 4 Ways Halcyon Embraces the IB Philosophy<\/a><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kerry Jenkins, Halcyon\u2019s IB MYP Coordinator, is one of our longest standing members of Staff \u2013 starting out as an MYP Science teacher in 2015 &#8211; and she continues to bring fresh perspective to our delivery of the MYP across disciplines.
