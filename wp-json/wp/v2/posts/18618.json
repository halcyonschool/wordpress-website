Both alumni secured places on prestigious degree programmes for which international travel is a core component &#8211; specifically to study in a variety of locations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas\u2019s World Bachelor in Business, delivered by the <a href=\"https:\/\/hkust.edu.hk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)<\/a>, has taken him to Los Angeles and next year will see him at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unibocconi.eu\/wps\/wcm\/connect\/bocconi\/sitopubblico_en\/navigation+tree\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bocconi University<\/a>, Milan. The opportunity doesn\u2019t end there, Tom notes. \u201cIn the fourth and final year, I will return to one of these institutions\u201d where he will have \u201cthe opportunity to specialise\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Similarly, Cosmo\u2019s place at the renowned <a href=\"https:\/\/escp.eu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ESCP Business School<\/a> allowed him to \u201cpursue this dream of travelling and immersing myself in different cultures\u201d. His Bachelor of Science in Management has taken him to Turin, via London, before returning to Paris next year, which has allowed him \u201cto pursue a high-quality degree while opening a world of professional opportunities internationally\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Smoothing The Transition To University And Beyond<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas highlighted that his time at Halcyon meant he could transition to university smoothly. \u201cHalcyon gave us such freedom,\u201d comments Cosmo, \u201csuch a landscape of topics to discover and a variety of people to meet, that at University, I felt as if I was entering a very similar environment, simply at scale, such that I felt completely ready to thrive.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmo seconded this. The transition \u201cwas smooth precisely because Halcyon and the IB Diploma Programme prepared us well for this unfamiliar learning environment.\u201d But it is not just university for which Halcyon prepared them effectively, highlights Cosmo: \u201cWhen I look at what I focus on professionally today, I actually find it quite easy to trace back to the courses I took at Halcyon\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Developing Students Who Can Lead<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas specifically highlights his \u201cincredible DP Maths class\u201d and how he will continue to use his passion for Maths when he graduates from HKUST and \u201centers the world of financial markets\u201d. He credits the IB as a whole, and his English class in particular, for teaching him \u201cto communicate through writing\u201d &#8211; and as someone who co-leads a startup, he believes the ability to \u201ccommunicate cogently\u201d is a quality of a \u201cgood leader\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leadership \u201cis something that\u2019s embodied in more or less everything a Halcyon student is brought to do,\u201d adds Cosmo, who also credits his English class and \u201cso much of the critical thinking\u201d for developing his leadership qualities. Building on this, he reiterates the importance of student autonomy, which is central to Halcyon\u2019s approach to the IB and Wellbeing. \u201cThe autonomy Halcyon gave us forced us to experiment and try unfamiliar things. Ultimately, those are the moments where you learn the most\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halcyon\u2019s delivery of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ibo.org\/programmes\/diploma-programme\/curriculum\/dp-core\/creativity-activity-and-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IB Diploma Programme\u2019s Creativity, Action and Service (CAS)<\/a> component is an example of the power this autonomy can have. Thomas and Cosmo\u2019s start up, Equity &#8211; an educational board game that makes finance more fun and inclusive  \u201cwas, in many ways, conceived within Halcyon\u2019s walls, most notably during our CAS project of delivering our Personal Finance and Stock Market course\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Grade 9-11 Careers Day approaching, current students have an opportunity to hear from inspiring speakers and consider, in earnest, how they might begin to shape their future. Thomas and Cosmo\u2019s experience demonstrates the importance of embracing the opportunities offered by the International Baccalaureate and the opportunities to build autonomy, which are a hallmark of Halcyon\u2019s holistic approach to education.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Read Thomas and Cosmo&#8217;s Community Spotlight Blog<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit Halcyon<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As Grade 9 -10 Careers Day approaches, our recent Community Spotlight stars and startup founders, Thomas Beaudet and Cosmo Vollauschek (Class of 2022), reflect on how Halcyon&#8217;s IB Diploma Programme prepared them for prestigious degrees and developed the resilience required to found a startup.
