Diploma Programme students may choose to study more than one Group 4 subject.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWith an emphasis on collaboration and communication, our labs are exciting environments where our students have the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding, apply a variety of methodologies and formulate their own hypotheses and scientific explanations. Students from Chemistry, Biology and Physics collaborate together in the Group 4 Project, and all students conduct individual project coursework as part of Halcyon\u2019s thriving Sciences programme.\r\n<br><br>\r\n*Quotations are taken from the International Baccalaureate Subject Guides.
