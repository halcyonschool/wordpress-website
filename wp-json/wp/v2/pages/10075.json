Beyond this, in order to produce empowered IB citizens who are prepared to use their unique potential to \u201ccreate a better world\u201d, we must also ensure that our curriculum is reflective of all experiences and voices &#8211; including those that are often unheard, or have been historically overlooked.<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As an IB school, we have always sought to deliver a curriculum that reflects a diversity of voices and historical perspectives &#8211; the International Baccalaureate learning framework supports this. We must continue to take a thoughtful and open approach to how we implement this responsibility in practice. As an international school in London, this also means ensuring that our learning is rooted in local contexts. In a hugely diverse city, we must continue to investigate and reflect on the local and global contexts that form the background to our learning. We continue to be ready to question assumptions, systems and ideas; to embrace different ways of understanding the world; and to take a stand against racism and any other form of discrimination.<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10083\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/VB21_HALCYON_D1_052-4headeroption.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"520\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We continue to take action to ensure that our curriculum is reflective of the diversity of culture, history, and voices which enhance learning experiences on both a global and local level, and we have provided some examples of student work below. It is important that our approach to diversifying our curriculum is visible to you, and we welcome thoughts and feedback from our community. Our students have a strong voice in shaping how we define our approach to learning, and we have also provided a brief insight into some student-led initiatives which reflect our community\u2019s commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.<br \/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In reviewing our teaching and learning, we must also be prepared to scrutinise ourselves: to be able to, as individuals and as a community, talk openly about the ways in which our preconceptions about learning and about one another can be a reflection of ideas and assumptions which might otherwise go unchallenged. As educators, we are taking steps to make progress on our personal journeys in a variety of ways, following a programme of intercultural competence training. <\/p>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:41px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<section class=\"explorations-section\">\n      <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <div class=\"col-lg-4 offset-lg-1\">\n            <h2 class=\"section-h pink\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">Spotlight: Grade 10 explore Civil Rights in History<\/h1>\n            <p class=\"section-p\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">The International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme &#8211; through which we develop a curriculum aimed at nurturing communication, self-management, thinking, research, and social skills &#8211; has always encouraged our students to explore, analyse, and evaluate a variety of perspectives as they develop their self-understanding and identity within the world. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn Grade 10 history, it is imperative that our students are welcome to investigate parts of the past where certain voices and perspectives have previously been unheard.

During the Q&#038;A portion of the event, Eva provided thought-provoking answers to questions from our students, staff, and parents: in response to a question on the most important insight she has gained during her career, Eva shared that &#8220;when you&#8217;re working in a developing country that is not your own, you have to be respectful, you have to be invited, and you have to respect local talent and leadership.&#8221;\r\n<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/unnamed-2022-09-15T121400.165.png\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h pink\">Reimagining Macbeth<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">This year, a Grade 11 English class took their audience analysis skills to a new level by reimagining a Shakespeare classic as a Netflix adaptation &#8211; a means of using their own varied cultural references to reshape a text that holds an established place in historical cultural capital. Demonstrating a strong understanding of the play&#8217;s themes and characters, each student took a different approach to the task of &#8216;modernising&#8217; Shakespeare &#8211; and one student even reworked Macbeth through the lens of a soundtrack. Angie (Grade 11) shared that she was particularly invested in the storyline of Macbeth, and found that creating a soundtrack and selecting song lyrics to tie in with a would-be Netflix series was an interesting and creative way of completing the project. \r\n<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n                     \n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"text-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <div class=\"row\">          \n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Buddha-Weekly-Lankesvara-Sutra-feature-Buddhism.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h pink\">Discovering new perspectives on humanity\u2019s relationship with nature<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Grade 9 classes sought to explore Earth\u2019s presentation in the media by researching a range of global perspectives on human relationships with nature. First, the class looked at key quotations from across human cultures &#8211; from The Lankavatara Sutra to The Bible to the World Wildlife Fund website &#8211; that dealt with our relationship to our environment. From these quotations, they were able to create different models of hierarchies communicating the power relationships between humans and nature. In one model, students found that humans were presented as \u2018above\u2019 the natural world, using it for their needs, whereas the other model presented an image where humans were intertwined with the natural world. Students were then able to discuss their differing views on nature in a constructive way through these shared worldviews.

This project resulted in presentations which were extensively researched, provoking their classmates to consider the complex details of the pandemic\u2019s economic impact in Rwanda, Bosnia, the USA, France and Kenya. Each individual presenter developed thoughtful policy solutions to the economic malaises in their country of study, many of which touched upon hotly-debated economic ideas of today. Luca, for example, proposed a youth training program to combat the high level of youth unemployment in Bosnia &#8211; which stands at over 50% &#8211; and, considering country\u2019s high national debt, suggested Modern Monetary Theory as a means of financing the programme.<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n                     \n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"text-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <div class=\"row\">          \n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Screenshot-2021-03-26-at-14.05.55-2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h pink\">Learning about bias in medicine<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">\u200b\u200bIn science, Grade 9 critically analysed global healthcare data to form a greater understanding of the role of bias in medicine across the world.

A school-wide wellbeing session<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">In Hyde Park, students from Grades 6 and 7 separated into small groups to engage in some team-building activities and discuss questions about our school culture together. Students reflected on the following question: &#8220;What does our school love the most?&#8221; This prompted students to think about the different meanings that &#8216;school&#8217; has for them: a question aimed at supporting students in building a shared culture with one another while sharing their own ideas, cultural perspectives, and backgrounds. As a continuation of this discussion &#8211; and after hearing perspectives from spokespersons in other teams &#8211; each group of students collaboratively developed answers to a further question: &#8220;What should our school love the most?&#8221; We hope that Grade 6 and 7 found this experience insightful. \r\n<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n                     \n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- hero -->\n<section class=\"title-section\">\n            <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-6 offset-lg-3\">\n                        <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\" class=\"section-p m-0 text-center\">\n                            <a name=\"voice\"><\/a>                           \n                        <\/h2>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"title-section title-same-line\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\">\n                <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\" class=\"section-h text-center cd-headline loading-bar bold teal\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"teal\" >Student Voice <\/p> \n                    <span class=\"cd-words-wrapper blue\">\n                                                \n                    <\/span><\/h2>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<section class=\"explorations-section\">\n      <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n          <div class=\"col-lg-4 offset-lg-1\">\n            <h2 class=\"section-h pink\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">Spotlight: Students feed back on DEI in the classroom<\/h1>\n            <p class=\"section-p\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">One of Halcyon\u2019s recent weekly staff learning workshops was led by the Student Council. The student team designed tasks that provided teachers with an opportunity to evaluate their success at integrating diversity, equity and inclusion into the curriculum. During a reflection task, a number of teachers shared that they had- often thanks to the input of students &#8211; found a number of ways to make their lessons provoke questions and promote inclusivity. This ranged from bringing in guest speakers and specialist instructors to being mindful of language choices in expressing expectations. In particular, teachers praised students for bringing their own questions and experiences to classroom sessions &#8211; something that always enriches our school community.<\/p>\n          <\/div>\n          <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n             <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/IMG_1600-2.HEIC-1-e1663240110586.jpg\"\/>\n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"text-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <div class=\"row\">          \n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/unnamed-49.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h pink\">Student-led MUN Conference: Accessibility to Education<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Joined online by Southbank International School, the London Nautical School, and Instituto Espa\u00f1ol Ca\u00f1ada Blanch (VCB), students debated a range of resolutions surrounding the main theme of &#8216;Accessibility to Education&#8217;, including improving teacher gender ratios in schools, supporting university graduates with entry-level work programmes, and putting in place quotas for gender balance in the workforce. <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/exhibition-3-1024x516-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h pink\">Combined art and history project: Exhibition on the Rohingya Genocide<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Our Global Issues Network team designed an in-school exhibition to raise awareness about the Rohingya Genocide.<br><br>\r\n&#8220;Our aim was to use different art media to raise awareness about the genocide. We included Rakhine state maps, images of the main perpetrators, and images of the victims alongside artistic elements such as blood-like handprints, a dimly lit room, survivors voices, and the intense music of conflict. This exhibition, inspired by our fascinating history classes, taught me the value of combining academia with art.&#8221; &#8211; Sabrina, Halcyon alumni\r\n<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n                     \n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":27,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10075"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10075"}],"version-history":[{"count":172,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10075\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14068,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10075\/revisions\/14068"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10075"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
