Students have independent opportunities to \u2018blend tools\u2019 &#8211; to use a mix of material paint and paper tools with digital devices. Students can create their oil paint masterpieces and review them in an instant through the use of an iPad editing programme, adding digital modifications and rearranging compositions to challenge the limits of their own creativity. <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/DSC03569-e1603790596742.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">Mathematics<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Mathematics brings Halcyon\u2019s students to engage with structures and patterns through algebra, geometry, and data science &#8211; to name a few.
