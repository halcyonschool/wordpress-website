Our Mother Tongue Programme celebrates Halcyon\u2019s varied linguistic heritage, while our English Plus programme empowers students to become connected, curious and skilled communicators in our community and our classrooms. \r\n<br><br>\r\nInternational-mindedness is a central part of the IB Learner profile. Creating a welcoming, celebrative and supportive international environment is key to our students\u2019 academic success. From celebrating our international community through International Night to providing a thorough \u2018Buddy Programme\u2019 to assist both parents and students in their overseas transition to Halcyon, a welcoming environment of internationalism thrives here.<\/p>\n                                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"text-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <div class=\"row\">          \n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">Mother Tongue Programme<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">We strongly believe in nurturing students\u2019 skills in their \u2018Mother Tongue\u2019 languages. Preparing our students for life is a core aspect of our pioneering understanding of education: and the workplace of the future will demand that our children interact with cultures all over the world.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe build our Mother Tongue programme around the needs of each student. Current Mother Tongue provisions include Swedish, Italian, French, Icelandic, Japanese, German, and Hebrew. <br><br>\r\nOur language curriculum is a key part of this culture of internationalism, and we ensure that every student has the chance to be engaged in learning a language as part of the IB curriculum. We also provide an \u2018English Plus\u2019 programme for non-native speakers. \r\n<br><br>\r\nOur Diploma Programme students have access to a wide range of languages that we will seek to provide depending on demand and students\u2019 initial ability. Our Grade 6-10 students may choose from either Spanish or Mandarin for the language component of the Middle Years Programme. <br>\r\n<h2>Languages: <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/academics\/subjects\/ib-language-and-literature\/\">IB Language and Literature<\/a><\/h2>\r\n<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">English Plus<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Our English Plus programme aims to uplift our non-native English speaking students in their learning. Our English Plus teacher provides assistance in bringing students to independently use online grammatical tools and vocabulary lists to equip them better in the classroom, as well as encouraging them to collaborate and assist each other as they develop their language ability. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEnglish Plus programme is bespoke: Ms Fairweather works with each student\u2019s other teachers to learn which concepts and vocabulary need further work. This means that our English Plus students do not miss out on their other subjects, but develop their understanding of them &#8211; it is fundamental that they are included as equal members of our community of learners from Day 1.\r\nWe invite you to read our blog on the successes of our <a href=\"https:\/\/hs.halcyonschool.com\/blog\/english-plus-at-halcyon\">English Plus<\/a> programme. \r\n<br><br>\r\n<span>Admissions<\/span>\r\n<br><br>\r\nPlease note that we do require students to have a capable level of English ability when they begin at Halcyon: this is detailed fully in our <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/admissions\">Admissions<\/a> critera.<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n                     \n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"links-section pl-3 pr-3 image-section\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-lg-4 mb-5 col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between pink\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/academics\" target=\"_self\">Academics<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between blue\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/student-life\" target=\"_self\">Student Life<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between yellow\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/success\" target=\"_self\">Student Success<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":81,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2777"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2777"}],"version-history":[{"count":50,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2777\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13282,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2777\/revisions\/13282"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2777"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
