From visiting the London Aquarium to enjoying exhibitions at the Design Museum, our students have delved into history from a variety of perspectives. This is also an opportunity for our students to connect with one another &#8211; every grade group will visit a different part of the city, forming lasting memories together. <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">What are Residential Trips?<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Residential Trips encourage our students to build their teamwork skills and nurture their bonds within their grade group.

These week-long trips usually take place at the beginning of the year, and are part of Grade 6\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/supporting-new-students\">transition to Halcyon<\/a>.
