I came to the UK to study for an MBA &#8211; my second masters\u2019 degree! I have worked as a Business Development Manager in the past, introducing South East Asian products and ideas to the UK. After five years in this industry, I decided to move into education, keen to use my experience of working in universities in Thailand for ten years. Halcyon was my answer! Here, I\u2019m the Purchasing and Facilities Officer, and I liaise with teachers and students to acquire new teaching resources, to book rooms, and to organise school-wide events, such as our Model United Nations Conference and International Night.

Before coming to Halcyon, I worked in Restorative Justice and other youth organisations. My background is mostly youth work and relational work with young people. At Halcyon, I also teach PSHE, Explorations, and some Extracurricular Activities. My role is, in my opinion, the most enriching one in the school &#8211; it is relational; I get to see every facet of the school and I get to know all students and staff very well. The reason that I chose Halcyon is because it is innovative and collaborative, and is able to work across cultures, throughout the community, to ensure that students have as wide and varied school experience as is possible.\u201d\r\n\r\n<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n                     \n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"text-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <div class=\"row\">          \n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_470_rp.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">Meet Oisin Byrne<br><small>IB DP &#038; MYP Spanish &#038; Theory of Knowledge Teacher<\/small><\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">\u201cHello, I\u2019m Oisin Byrne. I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya, where my mother ran an international school for nineteen years. I\u2019ve been here since 2013 &#8211; when Halcyon opened &#8211; and I teach primarily Spanish and Theory of Knowledge. I also coach the Senior Boys\u2019 football, and we run a tournament each year for local schools. What I like about working at Halcyon is the collaborative nature of working, as well as its integration of technology into the classroom environment, which works really well; our students are part of a generation of digital natives, after all. The students really have a desire to learn, there\u2019s a great sense of community, and a great atmosphere; I feel that the students really enjoy their time here.&#8221;<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/VB22_HALCYON_FEB_033.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">Meet Dr Sabahat Lodhi<br><small>IB MYP Science &#038; DP Chemistry Teacher<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">\u201cI was brought up in Leicester, central England, where I completed all of my education; primary to tertiary and beyond. After completing my industrial placement year at AstraZeneca during my BSc Chemistry, I caught the research bug and went on to do my Ph.D. in \u2018Synthesis of anticancer prodrugs\u2019. Whilst working on my research studies I got my first taste of teaching by supervising practical chemistry classes and teaching theoretical organic chemistry to MPharm students for their dissertation. For the past 10 years, I have been working in international schools in Italy, UAE, Brunei and, more recently, Germany. Most of my experience has been in IB schools. I am so pleased to have joined Halcyon because I am part of a diverse and dynamic community. The IB philosophy of global citizenship empowers students to go out and solve global challenges.

We do this to focus on the essential purpose of all schools &#8211; to all be at our best to educate. We prioritise meaningful learning impacts and professional growth, which means, for example, that our subject teams operate with a rotating shared leadership, appropriate to the particular task at hand. Everyone contributes and everyone has the opportunity to lead, to be accountable for school development and to enjoy the professional challenge of being a change-maker. It is our school, together.\r\n<\/p>\n      <\/div>\n      <div class=\"col-lg-3\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <p class=\"section-p\">Middle-leadership is generated through our project programme. Each year, we prioritise a number of intended learning impacts or wider intended improvements to our school culture, and create time-limited research projects which are led by different staff members. For example, we are currently supporting projects that will build more effective approaches to student voice, data analysis, sustainability, community partnerships, staff <a href='https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/wellbeing-team-cambridge-ucl\/'>wellbeing<\/a>, diversity equity and inclusion, design thinking and IB approaches to learning, and English language acquisition. Each project leader has the opportunity to have a profound impact on our school, to develop crucial professional leadership skills which enhance the whole organisation; and to collaborate with the community to ensure Halcyon remains a centre for innovation.\r\n<\/p>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"title-section title-same-line\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\">\n                <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\" class=\"section-h text-center cd-headline loading-bar bold pink\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"pink\" > <\/p> \n                    <span class=\"cd-words-wrapper blue\">\n                                                \n                    <\/span><\/h2>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"openDay-section\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n       <div class=\"row\">\n          <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1 d-flex align-items-start justify-content-center flex-column\">\n             <h2 class=\"section-h align-items-center text-center w-100 d-flex justify-content-between pink\">Be inspired by Halcyon <img src=\"\" alt=\"\">  <\/h2>\n             <p class=\"max-550 section-p\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/enquire\/\">Halcyon is guided by a clear mission \u2013 to provide an exceptional education that draws out the unique potential of each student \u2013 and is built upon three pillars: innovation, collaboration and community.<\/p>\n          <\/div>\n          <div class=\"col-lg-6 room\" style=\"background: url(https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/team-6.png)\" >            \n             <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between pink\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/enquire\/\" title=\"\">\n                Enquire Now                <svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\n                   <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/>\n                <\/svg>\n             <\/a>\n          <\/div>\n       <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n <\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":77,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/111"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=111"}],"version-history":[{"count":433,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/111\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14823,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/111\/revisions\/14823"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=111"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
