Following their unit on algebra, Grade 7 explored theoretical probability through real-life applications. Over the course of a lesson, Grade 7 students each produced a model of a probability game, and calculated the probability of each outcome for their mini slot machines and wheels of fortune. Grade 7 collected data by testing these games on Grade 6 students: through this information, they were able to review how experimental probability differs from theoretical probability.

Depending on their interests and intentions for further study, students may select either \u2018Mathematics: Analysis and Approaches\u2019 or \u2018Mathematics: Applications and Interpretation\u2019 as their IB Mathematics Diploma subject. Both options challenge students to gain a comprehensive and synthesised understanding of the categories and processes of mathematical inquiry, mathematical modelling, and technological applications of mathematics. Students\u2019 development of strong technology skills throughout their Diploma Programme studies of IB Mathematics prepares students to intellectually perceive the links between theoretical and practical mathematics.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt Halcyon, our students enthusiastically pursue opportunities to showcase their problem-solving, inquiry, reasoning and communication skills, in addition to their broader knowledge of Mathematics.
