First, the class looked at key quotations from across human cultures \u2013 from The Lankavatara Sutra to The Bible to the World Wildlife Fund website \u2013 that dealt with our relationship to our environment. From these quotations, they were able to create different models of hierarchies communicating the power relationships between humans and nature. In one model, students found that humans were presented as \u2018above\u2019 the natural world, using it for their needs, whereas the other model presented an image where humans were intertwined with the natural world. Students were then able to discuss their differing views on nature in a constructive way through these shared worldviews. You can read some of their writing here.<\/p>\n                                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<!-- image section -->\n\n<section class=\"image-section  \">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4 offset-lg-1 align-items-center d-flex\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                <div class=\"w-100\">\n                    <h2 class=\"section-h blue\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">Student Voice<\/h1>\n                    <p class=\"section-p\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">Whilst some of our staff are leading calls for more environmentally-conscious teaching in school, our focus on sustainability is shared by our whole community. In the summer of 2021, students led their own assembly on climate change &#8211; even running a school-wide quiz to test their peers&#8217; knowledge &#8211; which included coverage of perspectives and experiences of climate change from all over the world. They then requested their classmates&#8217; input on making Halcyon a more sustainable place to learn. We would like to encourage students who care deeply for our environment to join Halcyon&#8217;s Eco-Committee. <\/p>\n                    \n                                                                <a class=\"button blue-outline small\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/student-life\" target=\"_self\">Student Life at Halcyon <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/themes\/cbd%20update\/assets\/images\/arrow-blue.svg\" alt=\"\"><\/a>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1\">\n                                  \n                <img class=\"w-100 blue-frame blue-frame\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/green-halcyon.jpeg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n                \n                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":1,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/13994"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=13994"}],"version-history":[{"count":65,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/13994\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15072,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/13994\/revisions\/15072"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=13994"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
