In Grade 8\u2019s Jiu-Jitsu unit, students enjoyed learning the training principles and core moves of the sport, working with one another to practice their self-defense skills with the oversight of experts from a central London martial arts studio. The students also learned about the history and purpose of the martial art &#8211; one subject area of IB Physical and Health Education also encourages students to explore the theoretical side of their health and life choices as well as physical practice. Understanding the link of different areas of physical education to a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle also supports students in their development of exercise physiology knowledge, well being understanding, training methods, communication skills, team interaction, and leadership skills &#8211; central to the IB Learner Profile. In another unit, Grade 6 students completed an assessment based on investigating the nutritional content of popular drinks, taking on the role of educators by creating a guide of healthy snack suggestions and resources for their peers.<\/p>\n          <\/div>\n          <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n             <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/unnamed-11-2-e1619770301823.jpg\"\/>\n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"links-section pl-3 pr-3 image-section\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-lg-4 mb-5 col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between blue\" href=\"#curriculum\" target=\"_self\">Curriculum<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between pink\" href=\"#enrichment\" target=\"_self\">Enrichment<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between yellow\" href=\"#facilities\" target=\"_self\">Facilities<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- hero -->\n<section class=\"title-section\">\n            <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-6 offset-lg-3\">\n                        <h2 data-aos=\"fade-up\" class=\"section-p m-0 text-center\">\n                            <a name=\"curriculum\"><\/a>                           \n                        <\/h2>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"supplies-section  \">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                <div class=\"row supplies_row \">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-2 offset-lg-1\">\n                <h3 data-aos=\"fade-up\" class=\"section-h blue\">Curriculum<\/h3>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-8\">\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <p class=\"section-p\" data-aos=\"fade-up\"> <span>Physical and Health Education<\/span><br><br>\r\n\r\nPhysical and Health Education (PHE) is the Group 8 subject in the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme.
