Our Extra-Curricular Activities also include options aimed at bolstering all our students\u2019 university applications, providing further choices to engage in community service, to build civic skills, to explore specific career-related programmes, and to be creative or active. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWe also encourage our students to design, promote and run their own clubs, nurturing their trust in us and actively encouraging them to hold responsibility for their choices in education. Secure in the knowledge that Halcyon advocates for their individual interests, our students are happy and motivated to learn.<\/p>\n                                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"links-section pl-3 pr-3 \">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-lg-4 mb-5 col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between teal\" href=\"#ecalist\" target=\"_self\">List of Extra-Curriculars<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between teal\" href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/student-life\/explorations\" target=\"_self\">List of Explorations<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between teal\" href=\"#athletics\" target=\"_self\">Athletics Programme<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"text-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <div class=\"row\">          \n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_349-2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">Model United Nations<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Halcyon is proud to host a passionate and active Model United Nations team.

During our last trip to MUNISH, Boet and Stella (Grade 10) were nominated as two of 17 \u2018Best Delegates\u2019 \u2013 an incredible achievement, given that over 1200 students attended the event.\r\n\r\nOur mixed-grade MUN team enjoys the considerable responsibility of hosting Halcyon\u2019s annual student-led MUN Conference. Handling visitor invitations, organising resolution topics and welcoming guest speakers, the MUN team enjoys the challenge of debating and sharing knowledge with visitors from local independent and state schools across this two-day event.\r\n<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VB_20_Halcyon_p2_85_r_V1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">Sports Success<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">In their Spring 2020 inter-school tournament, the Senior Boys\u2019 Football Team won four out of five of their group games! Omar (Grade 12) came second for Player of the Tournament, and Halcyon won the Sportsmanship trophy. Halcyon is proud to maintain an excellent reputation for fair play.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Senior Girls\u2019 Football team equally delivered a fantastic performance throughout the tournament, reaching the final and placing second overall.
