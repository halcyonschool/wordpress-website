She has flourished into a thoughtful and dedicated learner, hoping to improve the quality of national and global public health through her work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis year, Clara began her Dentistry course at the Barts School of Dentistry, Queen Mary\u2019s University.\r\n<br><br>\r\nClara shared some thoughts with us about starting university, her future goals, and how Halcyon\u2019s community has helped in preparing her for a bright future.\r\n<\/p>\n                                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<!-- Quote section -->\n    <section class=\"quote-section \">\n        <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n                <div class=\"col-lg-6 offset-lg-3\">\n                    <p class=\"quote-p blue\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">I wanted to contribute to peoples\u2019 lives, health and overall happiness, and the more I learned about dentistry, the more I realised that dental health is a huge part of this.<\/p>\n                    \n                                        <span class=\"quote-signature\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">Clara<\/span>\n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:7.5%\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:85%\">\n<section class=\"general-content\" >\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h2>Success Story: Interview<\/h2>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Where has your life taken you since graduating from Halcyon?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After graduating from Halcyon, I took some time to prepare for my studies and to relax, of course. I took some online courses that covered a range of my interests; not just dentistry, but nutrition too. I spent most of my summer in France, and now I\u2019m back in the UK settling into my dentistry course at Barts, Queen Mary\u2019s University, which I began in mid-September.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>How has your Halcyon education prepared you for your current studies?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I think Halcyon has definitely helped me prepare for studying at university. Doing an <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/personal-learning\">IB Extended Essay<\/a> and completing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lanternaeducation.com\/ib-blog\/what-are-ib-internal-assessments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">internal assessments<\/a> helped me learn how to reference correctly; there are so many rules and guidelines to follow! Halcyon had experts to help guide us in areas like that. I\u2019d also add that I really developed my own study methods, my own way of focusing, and the drive to do my best at Halcyon.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Are you in touch with other Alumni?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Yes, since graduating I\u2019ve kept in touch with a fair few people from my class. The Halcyon community definitely goes beyond the time we spent at school.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>What sparked your interest in dentistry?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I actually first became interested in dentistry when I was 11. People are sometimes surprised when I say this, but I\u2019ve never changed my mind! I visited an orthodontist, who was the first person I had ever met who said that they loved their job. I wanted to contribute to peoples\u2019 lives, health and overall happiness, and the more I learned about dentistry, the more I realised that dental health is actually a huge part of this. Dental health impacts how you can eat, sleep, the rest of your bodily health, and your everyday life. It\u2019s really important, and it\u2019s a serious issue that so many people are scared of dentists.<\/p>\n<p>People often only visit a dentist when they\u2019re in pain, and at that point, it can often be too late. I really want to help dentists fight the myth of the \u2018scary dentist\u2019, because we should be acting on dental health prohibitively.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Could you tell us a bit about the course? How would you describe your experience of university study so far?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We are learning a lot of content through lectures, which are mostly being held online at the moment. We also have 6-10 lectures a week to self-study, which are recorded for us, and we can pause and rewind to capture all the details. Many of these are the same lectures taken by medicine students &#8211; we learn about the body, professionalism, working in a clinical environment, and academic skills too. I actually have an exam next week to cover all I\u2019ve learned so far &#8211; it\u2019s quite rigorous!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>What do you miss most about Halcyon?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The community aspect of Halcyon is what I miss the most &#8211; the relationship between students, and particularly the relationship between students of all grades. Halcyon is definitely unique in that sense, to my knowledge &#8211; I don\u2019t know of another school that provides such opportunities for students to make friends in different grade groups. I also miss the relationship between the students and teachers, who are always a listening ear and a voice of support.<\/p>\n<p>I think that Halcyon achieves the perfect balance of independence and a strong support network for its students, which is a tricky feat. The independence and self-management side of things has really helped me prepare for the independence of university life, but I do miss the personalised support of Halcyon &#8211; I don\u2019t have my own unique schedule or an individualised list of tasks to do anymore!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s next?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m looking forward to completing the rest of my initial studies, which will take five years &#8211; this includes 1-2 mandatory training years. After that, I can see myself spending a few years in the UK with the NHS, and then I might choose to specialise. Although it\u2019s early days, I have spent some time thinking about this, and I like the idea of opening my own practice one day. My sister is currently in Grade 12 at Halcyon, and she wants to study dentistry too &#8211; we\u2019ve kind of developed a shared dream of running a practice together. Of course, I\u2019ve not decided on any specific path yet. I can\u2019t predict my future interests or strengths, and choosing to specialise in something means you need to seriously apply yourself to expand your skill-set and knowledge &#8211; so I\u2019m sure my plans will develop over time.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts with us. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to say?<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>I just want to say that I really enjoyed my time at Halcyon, and I\u2019m really grateful to everyone there. All the teachers, the students, the staff &#8211; everyone there contributed to creating a great experience. It definitely prepared me for life &#8211; not just in a completely academic sense, but also in self-development and preparing me for what I\u2019ll face in the future.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"links-section pl-3 pr-3 \">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-lg-4 mb-5 col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between yellow\" href=\"\/success\" target=\"_self\">Read more about our Alumni<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:7.5%\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":63,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5073"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=5073"}],"version-history":[{"count":41,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5073\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":9469,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5073\/revisions\/9469"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=5073"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
