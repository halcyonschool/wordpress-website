Our Grade 10 students are applying their theoretical knowledge to the seasonal publication of the online \u2018Young People\u2019s Guide To Economics\u2019. The magazine explores economics through a different real-world focus in each volume &#8211; ranging from the economic impacts of COVID-19 to the new president\u2019s macroeconomic policies. This guide provides support for students in younger grades who are interested in studying economics at Diploma level at SL or HL, and broadens the information that Grade 10 students have access to: they will be able to use these real-world examples in their end-of-term assessment or Diploma Programme examinations. <a name=\"curriculum\"><\/a>\r\n\r\n<\/p>\n          <\/div>\n          <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n             <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ygpe2.jpg\"\/>\n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"links-section pl-3 pr-3 image-section\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n                                                <div class=\"col-lg-4 mb-5 col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between blue\" href=\"#curriculum\" target=\"_self\">Curriculum<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between pink\" href=\"#enrichment\" target=\"_self\">Enrichment<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <div class=\" col-lg-4\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                        <a class=\"link d-flex align-items-center justify-content-between yellow\" href=\"#facilities\" target=\"_self\">Facilities<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"Warstwa_1\" xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xlink\" x=\"0px\" y=\"0px\" width=\"18.989px\" height=\"16.98px\" viewBox=\"0 0 18.989 16.98\" enable-background=\"new 0 0 18.989 16.98\" xml:space=\"preserve\"> <path fill=\"#3A4B9C\" d=\"M9.568,0.693l7.495,7.306H0V8.98h17.063l-7.495,7.307l0.712,0.693l7.998-7.795l0.711-0.694l-0.711-0.693 L10.28,0L9.568,0.693z\"\/> <\/svg><\/a>\n                    <\/div>\n                                    <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"supplies-section  \">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n                <div class=\"row supplies_row \">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-2 offset-lg-1\">\n                <h3 data-aos=\"fade-up\" class=\"section-h blue\">Curriculum<\/h3>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-8\">\n                <div class=\"row\">\n                    <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <p class=\"section-p\" data-aos=\"fade-up\"> <span>Individuals and Societies (Group 3)<\/span><br><br>Individuals and Societies is a compulsory part of the International Baccalaureate that \u201cencourages learners to respect and understand the world around them\u201d*.
