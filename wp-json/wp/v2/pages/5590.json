A key part of the IB mission is that students strive to be \u2018active, compassionate and lifelong learners\u2026 who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect\u2019.<\/p>\n<h3>Spiritual, moral, social and cultural development includes:<\/h3>\n<p>&#8211; Exploring beliefs and experience; respecting faiths, feelings and values; enjoying learning about oneself, others and the surrounding world; using imagination and creativity; reflecting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Recognising right and wrong; respecting the law; understanding consequences; investigating moral and ethical issues; offering reasoned views.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Using a range of social skills; participating in the local community; appreciating diverse viewpoints; participating, volunteering and cooperating; resolving conflict; engaging with the &#8216;British values&#8217; of democracy, the rule of law, liberty, respect and tolerance.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Appreciating cultural influences; appreciating the role of Britain&#8217;s parliamentary system; participating in cultural opportunities; understanding, accepting, respecting and celebrating diversity.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"text-wrap\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n        <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n        <div class=\"row\">          \n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n                        <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/fbv-1.jpg\" alt=\"\">\n            <\/div>\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">Bletchley Manor Visit<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Grade 8 students explored Bletchely Manor on our Community Day in 2018.<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n           \n          <div class=\"col-lg-6\">\n             \n            <div class=\"text-box\">\n              <h4 class=\"section-h smaller-h teal\">What did the students learn?<\/h4>\n              <p class=\"section-p\">Halcyon&#8217;s biannual Community Days offer each grade group the opportunity to visit a different site in London to learn more about the richness of British cultural history. Grade 8 students visited Bletchely Manor to learn about the role of codebreakers who stayed on British territory during World War Two. <br><br>Bletchley Park was once the top-secret home of the World War Two Codebreakers from 1938. The codebreaking team successfully cracked the codes of German Army administration, German Airforce and later Italian and Japanese military. This produced vital intelligence in support of Allied military operations on land, at sea, and in the air during World War Two. Students explored the restored codebreaking huts and learned the story of the codebreaking teams, 75% of whom were women.  <\/p>\n            <\/div>\n          <\/div>\n                     \n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<section class=\"general-content\" >\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h3>Fundamental British Values are defined as follows:<\/h3>\n<p>&#8211;
