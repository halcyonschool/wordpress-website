These workshops are often an important space for our Project Leaders to share updates and resources on portfolios including Student Voice, Sustainability, Staff Wellbeing and more &#8211; this is a key part of our commitment to shared leadership.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn one of Halcyon\u2019s staff workshops, teachers considered how they could most effectively incorporate Halcyon&#8217;s commitment to sustainability into their daily practice. Martyn Steiner (Sustainability Project Leader and Science\/Environmental Systems &#038; Societies teacher) created a &#8216;staff leaderboard&#8217; using Google Sheets, determined by the number of &#8216;sustainability actions&#8217; that each staff member completed. These activities include having a chat with a colleague about sustainability ideas, visiting the student sustainability site, and sharing a sustainability-focused teaching resource with other members of our team. Celeste Gardner (PHE Teacher) and Stephanie Cooke (History and Individuals and Societies Teacher) also used this workshop to deliver a CAS\/Service as Action introduction to teachers. \r\n\r\n<\/p>\n          <\/div>\n          <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n             <img src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Instagram-Posts-8-e1611591737674.png\"\/>\n          <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":37,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3290"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3290"}],"version-history":[{"count":247,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3290\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15289,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/3290\/revisions\/15289"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3290"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
