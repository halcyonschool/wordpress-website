Coming to a diverse international school where \u201ceverybody is different\u201d means that every student has the opportunity to \u201clearn different perspectives\u201d, and nobody feels out of place at any time in the school day. \r\n<br \/><br \/> Saveliy highlighted our teachers as a key part of what makes Halcyon so special. \u201cThe teachers really value and care about students at Halcyon &#8211; this is much more than a job to them.\u201d He shared with us moments when teachers took their own time to provide feedback and words of encouragement, and explained how the teachers, just as much as their students, form a \u201cnon-judgemental community\u201d where everyone is encouraged to share their views, use their voice, lead and collaborate. \r\n<br><br><h2>Student life: Student profile<\/h2>\r\n<\/p>\n                    \n                                    <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1\">\n                                  \n                <img class=\"w-100 blue-frame blue-frame\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/IMG_9120-2-e1643906129765.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n                \n                            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<!-- image section -->\n<section class=\"title-section\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-12\">\n                <h2 class=\"section-h teal text-center\">Extra-Curriculars and Explorations<\/h2>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n<section class=\"image-section  pt-0 \">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"col-lg-5 offset-lg-1\">\n                                  \n                <img class=\"w-100 blue-frame teal-frame\" src=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/VB21_HALCYON_D2_447-2-e1643906078905.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/>\n                \n                            <\/div>\n            <div class=\"col-lg-4 offset-lg-1 align-items-center d-flex\" data-aos=\"fade-up\">\n                <div class=\"w-100\">\n                <h2 class=\"section-h teal\" data-aos=\"fade-up\"><\/h1>\n                <p class=\"section-p\" data-aos=\"fade-up\"><span>\u201cSchool activities are clearly driven to allow students to explore the unfamiliar, consider a range of perspectives and take informed risks.\u201d &#8211; NEASC, 2018<\/span><br><\/br>\r\n\r\nOur Extra-Curricular Activities, Personal Learning Programme and Explorations Programme engage students to explore their interests and become investigative, passionate inquirers, hosting a variety of options from <a href=\"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/blog\/lamda-club\/\">LAMDA<\/a> to Medics Club, aimed at nurturing students\u2019 aspirations beyond Halcyon. \r\n<br><\/br>\r\nExplorations are unique to Halcyon: two-hour periods on Wednesday afternoons dedicated to allowing our Grade 6-10 students to explore a selection of 34 learning journeys ranging from Archaeology to Robotics and Horse-Riding.\r\n<br><\/br>\r\nFrom Grade 6, our students are encouraged to discover their passions through our Personal Learning programme, a key part of our curriculum.
