Having worked closely in community outreach projects such as the organisation Education For All Morocco, she believes in the significance of students engaging in opportunities outside of school to develop their skills, as well as &#8211; most importantly &#8211; their passions. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWorking in University and Careers Counselling in other international schools both in and outside of London has allowed Asil to develop strong networking connections with colleagues and admissions officers at top universities around the globe, especially in North America and Europe. Asil has also enjoyed learning how to support students socially and emotionally and is excited to bring this learning to her role at Halcyon. <\/p>\n                                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"parent":122,"menu_order":93,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2727"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2727"}],"version-history":[{"count":140,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2727\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12054,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2727\/revisions\/12054"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/122"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/halcyonschool.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2727"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
